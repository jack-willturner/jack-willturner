ðŸ‘‹ Hello ðŸ‘‹ 

This is my personal page but most of my research code is released on the Bayesian and Neural Systems [group GitHub](https://github.com/BayesWatch).

I am a third year PhD student at the University of Edinburgh, supervised by Professor [Michael Oâ€™Boyle](http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/mob/) and Lecturer (Asst. Prof.) [Elliot J. Crowley](https://elliotjcrowley.github.io). I'm in the fourth year of the [Pervasive Parallelism](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/infweb/student-services/cdt/pervasive-parallelism) CDT programme.

My research interests include (but are not limited to!):

- Architecture rewriting in neural networks
- Optimising compilers
- Program transformations 

In my spare time I enjoy baking bread, [climbing rocks](https://github.com/jack-willturner/topo_apcher), and using Oxford commas.
