This is my personal page but most of my research code is released on the Bayesian and Neural Systems [group GitHub](https://github.com/BayesWatch).

I'm a software engineer at Qualcomm R&D, where I work on compilers and machine learning.

Before joining Qualcomm, I did my PhD at the University of Edinburgh, supervised by Professor [Michael Oâ€™Boyle](http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/mob/) and Lecturer (Asst. Prof.) [Elliot J. Crowley](https://elliotjcrowley.github.io). 

My research interests include (but are not limited to!):

- Architecture rewriting in neural networks
- Optimising compilers
- Program transformations 

In my spare time I enjoy baking bread, [climbing rocks](https://github.com/jack-willturner/topo_apcher), and using Oxford commas.
